Know v. 3

a P.o.E.M.M. platform by Jason Edward Lewis & Bruno Nadeau

Buzz Aldrin Doesn’t Know Any Better is a poem about crazy talking with a street-person outside a pawn shop on a sunny San Francisco afternoon. We released a version 2, renamed Know, that added texts by a set of guest poets.

Know v. 3 opens up Know P.o.E.M.M. app to the user, allowing her to enter her own text or assemble a text by searching on a keyword, hashtag or account name on Twitter.
